This project revolves around the ability to recognise sensitive words within documents. To do this I am making  use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the focus is on Named Entity Recognition which searches a body of text and classifies named entities into predefined categories.

# Problem Statement: 
Redaction is the actual process of removing sensitive information from documents. It typically involves someone manually going through a document word by word looking for sensitive information to remove â€” which of course is a very time consuming and tedious task that is prone to human error. The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that identifies the confidential words from the documents by considering the fact that information of the document is retained.
